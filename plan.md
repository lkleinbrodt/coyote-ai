# Dependency Resolution Plan

## Current Issues

- React version conflicts between multiple packages
- jest-expo and its dependencies require specific React versions
- Current React version (19.1.0) is too new for some dependencies

## Solution Steps

1. Update package.json to:
   - Add React and React Native as explicit dependencies
   - Pin React to version 18.3.1 to match react-test-renderer requirements
   - Add necessary peer dependencies
2. Clean npm cache and node_modules
3. Reinstall dependencies

## Implementation Notes

- Will use React 18.3.1 as the base version to satisfy most dependencies
- Need to ensure all peer dependencies are properly specified
- May need to update jest-expo configuration if issues persist
